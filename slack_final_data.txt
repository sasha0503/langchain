Daniel: I don’t know if we need to switch to Angular, what do you advise?

Sarah: Hi Daniel, I think Angular would be a great choice for our project. It has a lot of great features and is very popular in the industry.

Jack: Hey Daniel, I don’t think we need to switch to Angular. React has been working well for us and has a larger community.

Rachel: Agree with Jack, Angular isn't best choice, but probably we should take a look on Vue JS, my friend from other company likes it

Daniel: Thanks for all your input. I’ll take a closer look at Angular, React and Vue and make a decision soon.

Rachel: Ok, Daniel, with Vue JS it's better to start view some youtube videos rather than reading docs, good luck!
